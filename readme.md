This study investigates the chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of various essential oils, utilising both in vitro and in silico approaches to assess their efficacy against foodborne pathogens. Through GC-MS analysis,a rich terpene content in tea tree oil, with terpinen-4-ol as the predominant compound, and similar compositions in lavender and bergamot oils were identified. Peppermint oil, characterised by its high isomenthol content, showed the strongest initial antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, although all oils experienced a decline in this activity over 12 months. Encapsulation in alginate beads was found to effectively preserve the antioxidant capacity of these oils, suggesting a promising method for enhancing their longevity in food processing.

The study further employs machine learning techniques to analyse the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, identifying key molecular features that contribute to their efficacy. The use of the Random Forest model, highlighted the importance of phenolic compounds such as Carvacrol, Thymol, and Eugenol in combating bacterial cells. Conversely, aliphatic monoterpenoids were associated with reduced antibacterial activity. This research confirms the antimicrobial potential of well-known compounds and suggests novel agents against foodborne pathogens known for their antibiotic resistance. It offers insights into the molecular basis of antimicrobial activity and the potential for future research into phytochemical diversity and its application in the treatment of antimicrobial resistance.
